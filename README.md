# Honeypot-CAPTCHA
A type of captcha that is simple to implement and is based on the concept of a honeypot. Here a trap is set for the bots/scripts by adding an input field that is not visible
to the user but it is present in the code. So when a bot fills the form it fills the hidden input field as well and fails to submit the form.
